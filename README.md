This repository holds the code for the paper "Quantum Kernel Evaluation via Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference"

The code "Quantum Kernel Evaluation via Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference" demonstrates the simulated use of the Hong-Ou-Mandel based kernel as part of a hybrid classical/quantum machine learning algorithm to separate and classify data that is not linearly separable in its original feature space.
