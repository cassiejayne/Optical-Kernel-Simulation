This repository holds the code for the paper "Kernel State Encoding using Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference"

The code "Optical Kernel with Linearly Separable Data" demonstrates the simulated use of the Hong-Ou-Mandel based kernel as a classifier to classify a binary data set that exists in a linearly separable space. 

The code "Polynomial Optical Kernel with non-linear separable data" demonstrates the simulated use of the Hong-Ou-Mandel based kernel as part of a hybrid classical/quantum machine learning algorithm to separate and classify data that is not linearly separable in its original feature space.
